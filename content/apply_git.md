Summary: Invitation and Application Workshop Git/Github

## April 26, 2019: **Git/Github**

The Open Science Workshop Series continues. We are happy to announce our
upcoming Git/Github Workshop with Simon Schug.

**Version control**

Git keeps track of changes in your files and enables you to
store and restore specific versions.
Paired with an online repository, it helps you to transparently document the 
development of scientific data analysis pipelines (... and more!) and enables 
others to reproduce and reuse your work.

**Collaboration**

Github & Gitlab (and others) allow collaborators to seamlessly work together
on the same project and code base without losing track of who did what and
when. Additionally, they drastically facilitate sharing and maintaining of
open source code and enable you to systematically deal with bugs and updates.

The workshop is, like all of our workshops, free of charge for members of the
Frankfurt Open Science Community.
