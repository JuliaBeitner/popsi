# Power-Analysis Workshop 
## by Daniel Laakens
#### 22<sup>nd</sup> & 23<sup>rd</sup> October 2018  
**Teaching Format**  This course aims to help you to draw better statistical inferences from empirical research, improve the statistical questions you ask when you collect data, and design better and more efficient studies. In practical, hands on assignments, you will learn techniques and tools that can be immediately implemented in your own research, such as power analysis, thinking about the smallest effect size you are interested in, and other ways to justify your sample size. **Assumed quantitative knowledge**  You should have some basic knowledge about calculating descriptive statistics, and how to perform t-tests, correlations, and ANOVA's. A lot of the examples will be focused on experimental research, so having performed experimental research is useful as well.**Assumed computer background**  We will use R in many of the assignments, but you don't need any previous knowledge of R - we will mainly use it as a fancy calculator, and Daniel will guide you through everything you need to do. **Equipment and software requirements**  Please [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [install R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the workshop.Please [install these R packages](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/qIDymGsd3Ja9Xip). If needed, see [this help file](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484448-Editing-and-Executing-Code) on how to run R code.**Catering**  
Drinks and some snacks will be provided during the coffee breaks.
